# Ultra Light Face Detection

The Ultra Light Face Detection project aims to provide a lightweight face detection solution requiring minimal computational resources. This implementation utilizes Haar cascade models for efficient face detection.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to offer a face detection system that maintains a small footprint, making it suitable for devices with limited processing capabilities, such as Raspberry Pi or mobile phone cameras. The code's lightweight nature ensures seamless performance without compromising user experience, offering a reliable focal point and exposure targeting.

## Features

- **Efficient Face Detection:** Utilizes Haar cascade models for quick and resource-efficient face detection.
- **Minimal Resource Consumption:** Designed to operate smoothly on devices with restricted computational power.
- **Flexibility:** Can be adapted for various devices and integrated into different applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for initiating and stopping face detection.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python (with OpenCV, Tkinter, and Pygame installed)
- Sound file for face detection alert (Replace 'face_detected.wav' with the desired sound file)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Ultra_Light_Face_Detection.git
    ```

2. Run the 'Night_Security.py' script:

    ```bash
    python Night_Security.py
    ```

3. Use the provided GUI buttons to start and stop face detection as needed.

### Notes

- Ensure the necessary sound file ('face_detected.wav') is placed in the designated directory for face detection alert functionality.
- Adjust camera settings or indices if required within the code for different devices.

## Contribution

Contributions to enhance the efficiency, compatibility, or features of this lightweight face detection system are welcome. Feel free to create pull requests or raise issues to collaborate and improve this project.
